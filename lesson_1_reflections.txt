How can having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It will be an integral part of my day to day programming experience, as well as a useful tool for my day to day life.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You can first check to see the history and then compare the history at two different points. Doing so will result in a color coded print out that shows the differences between each line.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Nothing yet. I don't have any files to control or modify.
